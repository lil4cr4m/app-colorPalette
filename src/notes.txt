create airtable for favourites 
- air table is an online database that automatically creates an API for use 



can you pause here and go back to the beginning. i want my app to be able to generate a colour palette from an image link submitted by a user. color thief will process this link to display the image uploaded  and generate the color palette



the app should also have a favourites section where a user can save the color palette he or she likes. it be saved in an online database, airtable and there shoud be page that displays the likes and dislikes.



stretch goals

1. user can upload a photo into to generate the color palette

2. random function that will randomly select an image from unsplash, display the image and generate the color palette underneath it.
